# healh_insurance_prediction

I received this data from Kaggle. 

Leveraging data from a Health Insurance provider, I applied supervised learning algorithms to forecast whether previous year's policyholders might be interested in a newly offered Vehicle Insurance. The essence of insurance policies involves companies offering compensation for losses in return for a premiumâ€”a fixed payment from customers. For example, paying an annual health insurance premium of 500 dollars might secure a coverage of 200,000 dollars, based on the shared risk principle where premiums from many support the claims of a few.

This concept extends to vehicle insurance, where an annual premium ensures compensation for vehicular damages. By predicting interest in vehicle insurance, the aim is to enable the company to strategically plan its outreach, optimizing business efficiency and revenue. The model uses demographic, vehicle, and policy details to identify customers likely to be interested in vehicle insurance, demonstrating the practical application of machine learning techniques in enhancing business strategies.
